# Build and Program Your Own Computer with a Raspberry Pi

## Class Objectives
The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized computer developed specifically for teaching basic computing and electronics concepts.
Each student will learn:
- how to setup and use a Raspberry Pi
- learn how to control a computer using programming languages and tools
- design and create their own computer project
- learn many fundamental computing and electronics concepts

## Units
Topics of instruction will draw from the following units according to the age and skill level:
- **Building a Raspberry Pi computer**:  The basics include learning about the components of the Raspberry Pi, how to setup a working computer, and what you can accomplish with a Raspberry Pi.
- **Programming from Scratch**:  Basic computer programming concepts will be introduced using Scratch, a graphical programming language developed by MIT.
- **Designing Computer Graphics**:  Turtle graphics is a programming technique that enables students to develop complex designs with computer instructions.
- **Advanced Programming with Python**:  More advanced, text-based computer programming will be taught using Python, a widely-used high-level programming language.
- **Introduction to Electronics**:  The Raspberry Pi includes an interface for students to connect to custom electronic circuits using LEDs, switches, resistors, etc. 

## Class Supplies
Each student will work on their own Raspberry Pi.  The cost of that equipment will be included in the class fee.  At the end of the class, each student will be able to take home their own Raspberry Pi.  This includes the following itemized equipment list.
- Raspberry Pi, Model B+
- SD Card
- Power Supply
- Monitor Cable (HDMI to DVI)
